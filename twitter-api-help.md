#Getting access to the twitter API:

Getting access to the Twitter API is simple:

* Create account on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
* Go to [Twitter Developer app](http://apps.twitter.com)
* Log in with your twitter account
* Click “Create New App”
* Fill out the information sheet and create the application. If you don’t have a website, just fill that section in with a made up URL.
* After creating the app, click on “manage keys and access tokens” under “Application Settings.”
* Take note of the consumer API key and the consumer secret. We’ll need these to connect to the API later. Do not share these numbers with anybody else.
* Click on “create my access token” and take note of the access token and access token secret that are generated. We’ll also need these to connect to the Twitter API. Do not share these numbers with anybody else.
* Note that you can change app permissions from this page to allow access to features like direct messaging. The standard read and write permissions are fine for our purposes.
